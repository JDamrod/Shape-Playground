# 📐 Shape Playground (C++)

A console C++ application that demonstrates key **object-oriented programming** principles using geometric shapes and memory-managed classes. Includes drawing rectangles, working with squares, deep copying, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- Draws rectangles and squares using ASCII
- Demonstrates:
  - Class inheritance (`Square` from `Rectangle`)
  - Operator overloading (`Rectangle + Rectangle`)
  - Dynamic memory management with constructors/destructors
  - Copy constructor and assignment operator (`A` class)
  - Polymorphic behavior (`B` extends `A`)

## 💡 Concepts Used

- Classes & inheritance
- Memory management (`new`/`delete`)
- Constructor overloading
- Operator overloading
- Deep copy mechanisms
- ASCII graphics output in console
